## NCS-5700 400G Optics Technology and Roadmap

NCS-5700 is the first platform in the NCS-5500 Series that supports 400G optics, which is introduced in a previous tutorial:

[Introducing 400GE on NCS5500 Series](https://xrdocs.io/ncs5500/tutorials/introducing-400ge-on-ncs5500-series/)

This tutorial will discuss in more details the 400G optics technology and roadmap for the NCS-5700 series.

A follow on tutorial will discuss the 400G optics and breakout options supported for each port type on the NCS-5700 series linecards, NC57-24DD and NC57-18DD-SE.


## Introducing QSFP-DD MSA

QSFP-DD is the leading form factor for 400G optics, promoted by QSFP-DD [MSA](http://www.qsfp-dd.com/). Members include Cisco and other major suppliers.

QSFP+ and QSFP28 are the de-facto standard for high density 40G and 100G optics.

QSFP-DD is fully compatible with QSFP+ and QSFP28, and so maintains the same port density.
