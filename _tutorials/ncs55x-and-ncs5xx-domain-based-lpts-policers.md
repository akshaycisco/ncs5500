## Introduction

It has been a while since we wrote the [first](https://xrdocs.io/ncs5500/tutorials/introduction-to-ncs55xx-and-ncs5xx-lpts/ "first") article on LPTS. There we introduced the concept of LPTS and how it is implement on NCS55xx and NCS5xx family of routers. We also saw with examples how LPTS entries are created in the hardware and how they can be altered as per different requirements. In this document we will explore **Domain based LPTS Policers** and understand the use case of the feature.
