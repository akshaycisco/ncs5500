## Introduction

Episode 04 of the lab series, today, we will talk about NCS5500 fabric. More specifically, we will try to qualify the impact of losing a fabric card in a chassis.  
The goal of these blog posts is to describe tests performed in lab, detail the methodology and the results, and finally provide additional information on the internals of the NCS5500 platforms.  
All the former tests are listed here: [https://xrdocs.io/ncs5500/tutorials/ncs5500-lab-series/](https://xrdocs.io/ncs5500/tutorials/ncs5500-lab-series/)
