## Introduction

In our previous article we discussed [BFD over Bundle Interface or BoB](https://xrdocs.io/ncs5500/tutorials/bfd-over-bundle-interfaces-on-ncs5500-and-ncs500/). In this article, we discuss one more concept for bundle: BFD over Logical Bundle or BLB. We will understand the difference between BLB and BoB and see its use cases. We will also see Multipath and Multihop Sessions with BFD over BVI interfaces.
